# QA Execution Documentation — StreamForge

## Objective
Document evidence-based QA execution for **StreamForge** across source integrity, build/test readiness, functional behavior, negative paths, security configuration, and deployment.

## Test execution matrix
| Category | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Build | Install dependencies and run native build | Successful exit |
| Tests | Run available automated tests | All tests pass |
| Functional | Exercise documented core flows | Expected output/state |
| Negative | Invalid input and unsupported operations | Controlled error |
| Security | Inspect credential/configuration handling | No confirmed secret exposure |
| Deployment | Validate CI/deployment configuration | Valid workflow/configuration |

## Evidence standard
Execution status is based only on reproducible test/build/CI evidence. Static inspection is explicitly distinguished from runtime execution. Missing implementation, empty repositories, or unavailable external services are documented as limitations.

## Defect management
For each confirmed defect: record reproduction condition, expected behavior, actual behavior, root cause, fix, and post-fix verification.

## Status
**QA execution documentation completed.**
